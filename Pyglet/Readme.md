# Learning Journey: Pyglet Library

This repository documents my learning journey with the [Pyglet](https://pyglet.org/) library, a powerful Python library for developing games and visually rich applications. Here, you'll find notes, code samples, and experiments based on the official documentation and other resources.

## What is Pyglet?

Pyglet is a cross-platform windowing and multimedia library for Python, intended for developing games and other visually rich applications. It supports windowing, user interface event handling, OpenGL graphics, loading images and videos, and playing sounds and music.

## Official Documentation
